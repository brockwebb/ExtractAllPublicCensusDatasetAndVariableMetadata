The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level.

The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level.

Decennial Census: American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File,"The AIAN Summary File contains data on population characteristics, such as sex, age, average household size, household type, and relationship to householder.  The American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File (AIANSF) contains data on population characteristics, such as sex, age, average household size, household type, and relationship to householder. The file also includes housing characteristics, such as tenure (whether a housing unit is owner-occupied or renter- occupied) and age of householder for occupied housing units. Selected aggregates and medians also are provided. A complete listing of subjects in the AIANSF is found in Chapter 3, Subject Locator. The layout of the tables in the AIANSF is similar to that in Summary File 2 (SF 2). These data are presented in 47 population tables (identified with a ""PCT"") and 14 housing tables (identified with an ""HCT"") shown down to the census tract level; and 10 population tables (identified with a ""PCO"") shown down to the county level, for a total of 71 tables. 

Each table is iterated for the total population, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone or in combination, and 1,567 detailed tribes and tribal groupings. Tribes or tribal groupings are included on the iterations list if they met a threshold of at least 100 people in the 2010 Census. In addition, the presentation of AIANSF tables for any of the tribes and tribal groupings is subject to a population threshold of 100 or more people in a given geography. That is, if there are fewer than 100 people in a specific population group in a specific geographic area, their population and housing characteristics data are not available for that geographic area in the AIANSF.

Decennial Census: American Indian and Alaska Native Demographic Profile,"The AIAN Summary File contains data on population characteristics, such as sex, age, average household size, household type, and relationship to householder.  The American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File (AIANSF) contains data on population characteristics, such as sex, age, average household size, household type, and relationship to householder. The file also includes housing characteristics, such as tenure (whether a housing unit is owner-occupied or renter- occupied) and age of householder for occupied housing units. Selected aggregates and medians also are provided. A complete listing of subjects in the AIANSF is found in Chapter 3, Subject Locator. The layout of the tables in the AIANSF is similar to that in Summary File 2 (SF 2). These data are presented in 47 population tables (identified with a ""PCT"") and 14 housing tables (identified with an ""HCT"") shown down to the census tract level; and 10 population tables (identified with a ""PCO"") shown down to the county level, for a total of 71 tables. 

Each table is iterated for the total population, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone or in combination, and 1,567 detailed tribes and tribal groupings. Tribes or tribal groupings are included on the iterations list if they met a threshold of at least 100 people in the 2010 Census. In addition, the presentation of AIANSF tables for any of the tribes and tribal groupings is subject to a population threshold of 100 or more people in a given geography. That is, if there are fewer than 100 people in a specific population group in a specific geographic area, their population and housing characteristics data are not available for that geographic area in the AIANSF.

Decennial Census: Redistricting Data (PL 94-171),"Public Law 94-171, enacted in 1975, directs the Census Bureau to make special preparations to provide redistricting data needed by the 50 states. It specifies that within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the governor and legislative leadership in each state the data they need to redraw districts for the United States Congress and state legislature. To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords state officials an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting purposes. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks. State participation in defining areas is voluntary and nonpartisan.",2000.0,dec›pl,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl,dec,pl,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/DECENNIALPL2000,DECENNIALPL2000,DECENNIALPL2000,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,DECENNIALPL2000_PL004;DECENNIALPL2000_PL002;DECENNIALPL2000_PL003;DECENNIALPL2000_PL001
Decennial Census: Summary File 1,"Summary File 1 (SF 1) contains detailed tables focusing on age, sex, households, families, and housing units. These tables provide in-depth figures by race and Hispanic origin> some tables are repeated for each of nine race/Latino groups. Counts also are provided for over forty American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and for groups within race categories. The race categories include eighteen Asian groups and twelve Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander groups. Counts of persons of Hispanic origin by country of origin (twenty-eight groups) are also shown.
Summary File 1 presents data for the United States, the 50 states, and the District of Columbia in a hierarchical sequence down to the block level for many tabulations, but only to the census tract level for others. Summaries are included for other geographic areas such as ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and Congressional districts.
Geographic coverage for Puerto Rico is comparable to the 50 states. Data are presented in a hierarchical sequence down the block level for many tabulations, but only to the census tract level for others. Geographic areas include barrios, barrios-pueblo, subbarrios, places, census tracts, block groups, and blocks.

Decennial Census: Summary File 3 Demographic Profile,"The census of population and housing, taken by the Census Bureau in years ending in 0 (zero). Article I of the Constitution requires that a census be taken every ten years for the purpose of reapportioning the U.S. House of Representatives. Title 13 of the U. S. Code provides the authorization for conducting the census in Puerto Rico and the Island Areas.
After each decennial census, the results are released to the public in a variety of ways, including publishing multiple series of reports titled Census of Population and Housing. The abbreviation for these reports was CPH for some decades (including 1990 and 2010) and PHC for some decades (including 1970 and 2000).",2000.0,dec›sf3profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf3profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf3profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf3profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf3profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf3profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf3profile,dec,sf3profile,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/DECENNIALDPSF32000,DECENNIALDPSF32000,DECENNIALDPSF32000,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,DECENNIALDPSF32000_DP3;DECENNIALDPSF32000_DP2;DECENNIALDPSF32000_DP4;DECENNIALDPSF32000_DP2PR
Decennial Census: Summary File 4,"Summary File 4 is repeated or iterated for the total population and 335 additional population groups: 132 race groups,78 American Indian and Alaska Native tribe categories, 39 Hispanic or Latino groups, and 86 ancestry groups.Tables for any population group excluded from SF 2 because the group's total population in a specific geographic area did not meet the SF 2 threshold of 100 people are excluded from SF 4. Tables in SF 4 shown for any of the above population groups will only be shown if there are at least 50 unweighted sample cases in a specific geographic area. The same 50 unweighted sample cases also applied to ancestry iterations. In an iterated file such as SF 4, the universes households, families, and occupied housing units are classified by the race or ethnic group of the householder. The universe subfamilies is classified by the race or ethnic group of the reference person for the subfamily. In a husband/wife subfamily, the reference person is the husband; in a parent/child subfamily, the reference person is always the parent. The universes population in households, population in families, and population in subfamilies are classified by the race or ethnic group of the inidviduals within the household, family, or subfamily without regard to the race or ethnicity of the householder. Notes follow selected tables to make the classification of the universe clear. In any population table where there is no note, the universe classification is always based on the race or ethnicity of the person. In all housing tables, the universe classification is based on the race or ethnicity of the

Decennial Census: Summary File 4 Demographic Profile,"Summary File 4 is repeated or iterated for the total population and 335 additional population groups: 132 race groups,78 American Indian and Alaska Native tribe categories, 39 Hispanic or Latino groups, and 86 ancestry groups.Tables for any population group excluded from SF 2 because the group's total population in a specific geographic area did not meet the SF 2 threshold of 100 people are excluded from SF 4. Tables in SF 4 shown for any of the above population groups will only be shown if there are at least 50 unweighted sample cases in a specific geographic area. The same 50 unweighted sample cases also applied to ancestry iterations. In an iterated file such as SF 4, the universes households, families, and occupied housing units are classified by the race or ethnic group of the householder. The universe subfamilies is classified by the race or ethnic group of the reference person for the subfamily. In a husband/wife subfamily, the reference person is the husband; in a parent/child subfamily, the reference person is always the parent. The universes population in households, population in families, and population in subfamilies are classified by the race or ethnic group of the inidviduals within the household, family, or subfamily without regard to the race or ethnicity of the householder. Notes follow selected tables to make the classification of the universe clear. In any population table where there is no note, the universe classification is always based on the race or ethnicity of the person. In all housing tables, the universe classification is based on the race or ethnicity of the householder.",2000.0,dec›sf4profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf4profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf4profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf4profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf4profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf4profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf4profile,dec,sf4profile,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/DECENNIALDPSF42000,DECENNIALDPSF42000,DECENNIALDPSF42000,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,DECENNIALDPSF42000_DP1;DECENNIALDPSF42000_DP3;DECENNIALDPSF42000_DP2;DECENNIALDPSF42000_DP4;DECENNIALDPSF42000_DP2PR

2000 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",2000.0,nonemp,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/nonemp/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/nonemp/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/nonemp/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/nonemp/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/nonemp/examples.html,http://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2000/nonemp,nonemp,,,,,http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2000,NONEMP2000,NONEMP2000,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,No Group,NA
2000 Population Estimates - 2000-2010 Intercensal Estimates: Characteristics by Single Year of Age,"Annual Intercensal Resident Population Estimates by Single Year of Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States, and by Single Year of Age and Sex for Puerto Rico Commonwealth: April 1, 2000 to April 1, 2010 // Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division // Note: 'In combination' means in combination with one or more other races. The sum of the five race-in-combination groups adds to more than the total population because individuals may report more than one race. Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race.

2001 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level.

The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more.  Data profiles contain broad social, economic, housing, and demographic information. The data are presented as population counts and percentages.

2005 American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample,"The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains a sample of responses to the ACS. The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels.

2005 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns,"County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP).

Mar 2005 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement,"The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

2006 American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample,"The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains a sample of responses to the ACS. The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit.

2006 American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates - Puerto Rico Public Use Microdata Sample,"The Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) for Puerto Rico (PR) contains a sample of responses to the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS). The PRCS is similar to, but separate from, the American Community Survey (ACS). The PRCS collects data about the population and housing units in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico data is not included in the national PUMS files. It is published as a state equivalent file and has a State FIPS code of ""72"". The file includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members.

This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

2006 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",2006.0,nonemp,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp/examples.html,http://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp,nonemp,,,,,http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2006,NONEMP2006,NONEMP2006,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,No Group,NA

The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition each state into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Detailed Tables 3-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2007.0,acs›acs3,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3,acs,acs3,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDT3Y2007,ACSDT3Y2007,ACSDT3Y2007,Has

American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Data Profiles 3-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2007.0,acs›acs3›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/acs/acs3/profile,acs,acs3,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP3Y2007,ACSDP3Y2007,ACSDP3Y2007,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP3Y2007_DP04;ACSDP3Y2007_DP05;ACSDP3Y2007_DP02PR;ACSDP3Y2007_DP02;ACSDP3Y2007_DP03
2007 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns,"County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

Mar 2007 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement,"The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.",2007.0,cps›asec›mar,Microdata,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar,cps,asec,,,Mar,https://api.census.gov/data/id/CPSASEC2007,CPSASEC2007,CPSASEC2007,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,No Group,NA

The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level.

2008 American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample,"The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains a sample of responses to the ACS. The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels.

American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Detailed Tables 3-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2008.0,acs›acs3,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3,acs,acs3,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDT3Y2008,ACSDT3Y2008,ACSDT3Y2008,Has

American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Data Profiles 3-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2008.0,acs›acs3›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2008/acs/acs3/profile,acs,acs3,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP3Y2008,ACSDP3Y2008,ACSDP3Y2008,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP3Y2008_DP04;ACSDP3Y2008_DP05;ACSDP3Y2008_DP02PR;ACSDP3Y2008_DP02;ACSDP3Y2008_DP03

This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

Mar 2008 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement,"The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

2008 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax.

The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

2009 American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample,"The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains a sample of responses to the ACS. The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file.

2009 American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates - Puerto Rico Public Use Microdata Sample,"The Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) for Puerto Rico (PR) contains a sample of responses to the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS). The PRCS is similar to, but separate from, the American Community Survey (ACS). The PRCS collects data about the population and housing units in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico data is not included in the national PUMS files. It is published as a state equivalent file and has a State FIPS code of ""72"".

American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Detailed Tables 3-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing

American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Data Profiles 3-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2009.0,acs›acs3›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs3/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs3/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs3/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs3/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs3/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs3/profile,acs,acs3,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP3Y2009,ACSDP3Y2009,ACSDP3Y2009,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP3Y2009_DP04;ACSDP3Y2009_DP05;ACSDP3Y2009_DP02PR;ACSDP3Y2009_DP02;ACSDP3Y2009_DP03

The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. The data profiles include the following geographies: nation, all states (including DC and Puerto Rico), all metropolitan areas, all congressional districts, all counties, all places and all tracts. Data profiles contain broad social, economic, housing, and demographic information. The data are presented as both counts and percentages.

2005-2009 American Community Survey: 5-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample,"The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains a sample of responses to the ACS. The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition each state into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each. ACS PUMS files for an individual year, such as 2019, contain data on approximately one percent of the United States population.",2009.0,acs›acs5›pums,Microdata,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs5/pums/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs5/pums/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs5/pums/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs5/pums/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs5/pums/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs5/pums,acs,acs5,pums,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSPUMS5Y2009,ACSPUMS5Y2009,ACSPUMS5Y2009,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,No Group,NA

Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. Data are available at the state and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition Puerto Rico into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

2009 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",2009.0,nonemp,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/examples.html,http://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp,nonemp,,,,,http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2009,NONEMP2009,NONEMP2009,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,No Group,NA

ACS 1-Year Detailed Tables,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The 2012 data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2010.0,acs›acs1,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs1/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs1/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs1/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs1/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs1/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs1,acs,acs1,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDT1Y2010,ACSDT1Y2010,ACSDT1Y2010,Has

ACS 1-Year Comparison Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex.  Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more.

ACS 1-Year Data Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

The variables change for each dataset and do not repeat in overlapping datasets.

This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll.

This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

Mar 2010 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement,"The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status.

Decennial Census: American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File,"The AIAN Summary File contains data on population characteristics, such as sex, age, average household size, household type, and relationship to householder.  The American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File (AIANSF) contains data on population characteristics, such as sex, age, average household size, household type, and relationship to householder. The file also includes housing characteristics, such as tenure (whether a housing unit is owner-occupied or renter- occupied) and age of householder for occupied housing units. Selected aggregates and medians also are provided. A complete listing of subjects in the AIANSF is found in Chapter 3, Subject Locator. The layout of the tables in the AIANSF is similar to that in Summary File 2 (SF 2). These data are presented in 47 population tables (identified with a ""PCT"") and 14 housing tables (identified with an ""HCT"") shown down to the census tract level; and 10 population tables (identified with a ""PCO"") shown down to the county level, for a total of 71 tables. 

Each table is iterated for the total population, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone or in combination, and 1,567 detailed tribes and tribal groupings. Tribes or tribal groupings are included on the iterations list if they met a threshold of at least 100 people in the 2010 Census. In addition, the presentation of AIANSF tables for any of the tribes and tribal groupings is subject to a population threshold of 100 or more people in a given geography. That is, if there are fewer than 100 people in a specific population group in a specific geographic area, their population and housing characteristics data are not available for that geographic area in the AIANSF.

Decennial Census: Redistricting Data (PL 94-171),"Public Law 94-171, enacted in 1975, directs the Census Bureau to make special preparations to provide redistricting data needed by the 50 states. It specifies that within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the governor and legislative leadership in each state the data they need to redraw congressional and state legislative districts. To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords the states an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks.

2010 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",2010.0,nonemp,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/nonemp/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/nonemp/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/nonemp/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/nonemp/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/nonemp/examples.html,http://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2010/nonemp,nonemp,,,,,http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2010,NONEMP2010,NONEMP2010,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,No Group,NA
2010 Decennial Census of Population and Housing: Surnames,"The Census Bureau's Census surnames product is a data release based on names recorded in the decennial census.

ACS 1-Year Detailed Tables,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The 2012 data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2011.0,acs›acs1,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs1/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs1/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs1/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs1/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs1/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs1,acs,acs1,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDT1Y2011,ACSDT1Y2011,ACSDT1Y2011,Has

ACS 1-Year Comparison Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex.  Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more.

ACS 1-Year Data Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Data Profiles 3-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2011.0,acs›acs3›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs3/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs3/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs3/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs3/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs3/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs3/profile,acs,acs3,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP3Y2011,ACSDP3Y2011,ACSDP3Y2011,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP3Y2011_DP04;ACSDP3Y2011_DP05;ACSDP3Y2011_DP02PR;ACSDP3Y2011_DP02;ACSDP3Y2011_DP03

ACS 5-Year Data Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS 5-year data profiles include the following geographies: nation, all states (including DC and Puerto Rico), all metropolitan areas, all congressional districts, all counties, all places and all tracts. The Data profiles contain broad social, economic, housing, and demographic information. The data are presented as both counts and percentages. There are over 2,400 variables in this dataset.",2011.0,acs›acs5›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs5/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs5/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs5/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs5/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs5/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs5/profile,acs,acs5,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP5Y2011,ACSDP5Y2011,ACSDP5Y2011,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP5Y2011_DP04;ACSDP5Y2011_DP05;ACSDP5Y2011_DP02PR;ACSDP5Y2011_DP02;ACSDP5Y2011_DP03
2007-2011 American Community Survey: 5-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample,"The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains a sample of responses to the ACS. The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file.

2007-2011 American Community Survey: 5-Year Estimates - Puerto Rico Public Use Microdata Sample,"The Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) for Puerto Rico (PR) contains a sample of responses to the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS). The PRCS is similar to, but separate from, the American Community Survey (ACS). The PRCS collects data about the population and housing units in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico data is not included in the national PUMS files. It is published as a state equivalent file and has a State FIPS code of “72”. The file includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. Data are available at the state and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels.

2011 American Community Survey 1-Year Profiles for the 113th Congressional Districts,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2011.0,acs1›cd113,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113/examples.html,http://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113,acs1,cd113,,,,http://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSCD1132011,ACSCD1132011,ACSCD1132011,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,No Group,NA

2011 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",2011.0,nonemp,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/examples.html,http://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp,nonemp,,,,,http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2011,NONEMP2011,NONEMP2011,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,No Group,NA

ACS 1-Year Detailed Tables,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The 2012 data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing

ACS 1-Year Comparison Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex. Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more.

ACS 1-Year Data Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Comparison Profiles 3-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population.  The comparison profiles include the following geographies: nation, all states (including DC and Puerto Rico), all metropolitan areas, all congressional districts, all counties and all places with a population of 5,000 or more.

American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Data Profiles 3-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2012.0,acs›acs3›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/acs3/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/acs3/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/acs3/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/acs3/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/acs3/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/acs3/profile,acs,acs3,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP3Y2012,ACSDP3Y2012,ACSDP3Y2012,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP3Y2012_DP04;ACSDP3Y2012_DP05;ACSDP3Y2012_DP02PR;ACSDP3Y2012_DP02;ACSDP3Y2012_DP03

NOTE: 
Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. 

The projections generally do not precisely agree with population estimates available elsewhere on the Census Bureau website for methodological reasons. Where both estimates and projections are available for a given time reference, we recommend that you use the population estimates as the measure of the current population.

The U.S. Census Bureau periodically produces projections of the United States resident population by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Population projections are estimates of the population for future dates. They are typically based on an estimated population consistent with the most recent decennial census and are produced using the cohort-component method. Projections illustrate possible courses of population change based on assumptions about future births, deaths, net international migration, and domestic migration. In some cases, several series of projections are produced based on alternative assumptions for future fertility, life expectancy, net international migration, and (for state-level projections) state-to-state or domestic migration.

ACS 1-Year Detailed Tables,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The 2012 data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing

ACS 1-Year Data Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2013.0,acs›acs1›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs1/profile,acs,acs1,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP1Y2013,ACSDP1Y2013,ACSDP1Y2013,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP1Y2013_DP04;ACSDP1Y2013_DP05;ACSDP1Y2013_DP02PR;ACSDP1Y2013_DP02;ACSDP1Y2013_DP03

American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Detailed Tables 3-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2013.0,acs›acs3,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3,acs,acs3,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP3Y2013,,ACSDP3Y2013,Has

American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Data Profiles 3-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2013.0,acs›acs3›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs/acs3/profile,acs,acs3,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP3Y2013,ACSDP3Y2013,ACSDP3Y2013,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP3Y2013_DP04;ACSDP3Y2013_DP05;ACSDP3Y2013_DP02PR;ACSDP3Y2013_DP02;ACSDP3Y2013_DP03

2009-2013 American Community Survey: Migration Flows,"Migration flows are derived from the relationship between the location of current residence in the American Community Survey (ACS) sample and the responses given to the migration question ""Where did you live 1 year ago?"".  There are flow statistics (moved in, moved out, and net moved) between county or minor civil division (MCD) of residence and county, MCD, or world region of residence 1 year ago.  Estimates for MCDs are only available for the 12 strong-MCD states, where the MCDs have the same government functions as incorporated places.  Migration flows between metropolitan statistical areas are available starting with the 2009-2013 5-year ACS dataset.

ACS 1-Year Data Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2014.0,acs›acs1›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile,acs,acs1,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP1Y2014,ACSDP1Y2014,ACSDP1Y2014,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP1Y2014_DP04;ACSDP1Y2014_DP05;ACSDP1Y2014_DP02PR;ACSDP1Y2014_DP02;ACSDP1Y2014_DP03

ACS 1-Year Supplemental Estimates,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

ACS 1-Year Detailed Tables,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The 2012 data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

ACS 1-Year Data Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2015.0,acs›acs1›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acs1/profile,acs,acs1,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP1Y2015,ACSDP1Y2015,ACSDP1Y2015,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP1Y2015_DP04;ACSDP1Y2015_DP05;ACSDP1Y2015_DP02PR;ACSDP1Y2015_DP02;ACSDP1Y2015_DP03

ACS 1-Year Supplemental Estimates,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2015.0,acs›acsse,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse,acs,acsse,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSSE2015,ACSSE2015,ACSSE2015,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSSE2015_K202002;ACSSE2015_K200101;ACSSE2015_K202201;ACSSE2015_K200102;ACSSE2015_K202402;ACSSE2015_K200103;ACSSE2015_K200301;ACSSE2015_K202401;ACSSE2015_K200104;ACSSE2015_K200501;ACSSE2015_K202403;ACSSE2015_K202601;ACSSE2015_K200503;ACSSE2015_K200701;ACSSE2015_K202801;ACSSE2015_K200901;ACSSE2015_K201001;ACSSE2015_K201401;ACSSE2015_K201601;ACSSE2015_K201801;ACSSE2015_K201803;ACSSE2015_K201802;ACSSE2015_K202101;ACSSE2015_K200001;ACSSE2015_K202301;ACSSE2015_K200002;ACSSE2015_K202102;ACSSE2015_K200201;ACSSE2015_K202501;ACSSE2015_K200501PR;ACSSE2015_K202302;ACSSE2015_K202503;ACSSE2015_K202701;ACSSE2015_K200503PR;ACSSE2015_K202502;ACSSE2015_K202505;ACSSE2015_K202703;ACSSE2015_K202504;ACSSE2015_K202702;ACSSE2015_K200801;ACSSE2015_K202507;ACSSE2015_K200802;ACSSE2015_K202506;ACSSE2015_K202509;ACSSE2015_K202508;ACSSE2015_K201102;ACSSE2015_K202510;ACSSE2015_K200701PR;ACSSE2015_K201101;ACSSE2015_K202511;ACSSE2015_K201501;ACSSE2015_K201702;ACSSE2015_K201701;ACSSE2015_K201902;ACSSE2015_K201703;ACSSE2015_K201901;ACSSE2015_K201904;ACSSE2015_K201903;ACSSE2015_K201905

ACS 1-Year Data Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2016.0,acs›acs1›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile,acs,acs1,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP1Y2016,ACSDP1Y2016,ACSDP1Y2016,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP1Y2016_DP04;ACSDP1Y2016_DP05;ACSDP1Y2016_DP02PR;ACSDP1Y2016_DP02;ACSDP1Y2016_DP03

ACS 1-Year Supplemental Estimates,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2016.0,acs›acsse,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse,acs,acsse,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSSE2016,ACSSE2016,ACSSE2016,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSSE2016_K202002;ACSSE2016_K200101;ACSSE2016_K202201;ACSSE2016_K200102;ACSSE2016_K202402;ACSSE2016_K200103;ACSSE2016_K200301;ACSSE2016_K202401;ACSSE2016_K200104;ACSSE2016_K200501;ACSSE2016_K202403;ACSSE2016_K202601;ACSSE2016_K200503;ACSSE2016_K200701;ACSSE2016_K202801;ACSSE2016_K200901;ACSSE2016_K201001;ACSSE2016_K201401;ACSSE2016_K201601;ACSSE2016_K201801;ACSSE2016_K201803;ACSSE2016_K201802;ACSSE2016_K202101;ACSSE2016_K200001;ACSSE2016_K202301;ACSSE2016_K200002;ACSSE2016_K202102;ACSSE2016_K200201;ACSSE2016_K202501;ACSSE2016_K200501PR;ACSSE2016_K202302;ACSSE2016_K202503;ACSSE2016_K202701;ACSSE2016_K200503PR;ACSSE2016_K202502;ACSSE2016_K202505;ACSSE2016_K202703;ACSSE2016_K202504;ACSSE2016_K202702;ACSSE2016_K200801;ACSSE2016_K202507;ACSSE2016_K200802;ACSSE2016_K202506;ACSSE2016_K202509;ACSSE2016_K202508;ACSSE2016_K201102;ACSSE2016_K202510;ACSSE2016_K200701PR;ACSSE2016_K201101;ACSSE2016_K202511;ACSSE2016_K201501;ACSSE2016_K201702;ACSSE2016_K201701;ACSSE2016_K201902;ACSSE2016_K201703;ACSSE2016_K201901;ACSSE2016_K201904;ACSSE2016_K201903;ACSSE2016_K201905

ACS 1-Year Data Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2017.0,acs›acs1›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acs1/profile,acs,acs1,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP1Y2017,ACSDP1Y2017,ACSDP1Y2017,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP1Y2017_DP04;ACSDP1Y2017_DP05;ACSDP1Y2017_DP02PR;ACSDP1Y2017_DP02;ACSDP1Y2017_DP03

ACS 1-Year Supplemental Estimates,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2017.0,acs›acsse,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acsse/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acsse/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acsse/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acsse/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acsse/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acsse,acs,acsse,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSSE2017,ACSSE2017,ACSSE2017,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSSE2017_K202002;ACSSE2017_K200101;ACSSE2017_K202201;ACSSE2017_K200102;ACSSE2017_K202402;ACSSE2017_K200103;ACSSE2017_K200301;ACSSE2017_K202401;ACSSE2017_K200104;ACSSE2017_K200501;ACSSE2017_K202403;ACSSE2017_K202601;ACSSE2017_K200701;ACSSE2017_K200503;ACSSE2017_K202801;ACSSE2017_K200901;ACSSE2017_K201001;ACSSE2017_K201401;ACSSE2017_K201601;ACSSE2017_K201801;ACSSE2017_K201803;ACSSE2017_K201802;ACSSE2017_K202101;ACSSE2017_K200001;ACSSE2017_K202301;ACSSE2017_K200002;ACSSE2017_K202102;ACSSE2017_K200201;ACSSE2017_K202501;ACSSE2017_K200501PR;ACSSE2017_K202302;ACSSE2017_K202503;ACSSE2017_K202701;ACSSE2017_K200503PR;ACSSE2017_K202502;ACSSE2017_K202505;ACSSE2017_K202703;ACSSE2017_K202504;ACSSE2017_K202702;ACSSE2017_K200801;ACSSE2017_K202507;ACSSE2017_K200802;ACSSE2017_K202506;ACSSE2017_K202509;ACSSE2017_K202508;ACSSE2017_K201102;ACSSE2017_K202510;ACSSE2017_K200701PR;ACSSE2017_K201101;ACSSE2017_K202511;ACSSE2017_K201501;ACSSE2017_K201702;ACSSE2017_K201701;ACSSE2017_K201902;ACSSE2017_K201703;ACSSE2017_K201901;ACSSE2017_K201904;ACSSE2017_K201903;ACSSE2017_K201905

Mar 2017 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement,"The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census.

The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status.

American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Comparison Profiles 1-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex. Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Comparison profiles are similar to data profiles but also include comparisons with past-year data. The current year data are compared with each of the last four years of data and include statistical significance testing.

ACS 1-Year Profile Tables,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2018.0,acs›acs1›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile,acs,acs1,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP1Y2018,ACSDP1Y2018,ACSDP1Y2018,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP1Y2018_DP04;ACSDP1Y2018_DP05;ACSDP1Y2018_DP02PR;ACSDP1Y2018_DP02;ACSDP1Y2018_DP03
2018 American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample,"The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains a sample of responses to the ACS. The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition each state into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

2014-2018 American Community Survey: 5-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample,"The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains a sample of responses to the ACS. The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file.

2014-2018 American Community Survey: 5-Year Estimates - Puerto Rico Public Use Microdata Sample,"The Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) for Puerto Rico (PR) contains a sample of responses to the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS). The PRCS is similar to, but separate from, the American Community Survey (ACS). The PRCS collects data about the population and housing units in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico data is not included in the national PUMS files. It is published as a state equivalent file and has a State FIPS code of “72”. The file includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. Data are available at the state and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels.

ACS 1-Year Supplemental Estimates,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Comparison Profiles 1-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex. Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Comparison profiles are similar to data profiles but also include comparisons with past-year data. The current year data are compared with each of the last four years of data and include statistical significance testing.

American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Data Profiles 1-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2019.0,acs›acs1›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile,acs,acs1,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP1Y2019,ACSDP1Y2019,ACSDP1Y2019,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP1Y2019_DP04;ACSDP1Y2019_DP05;ACSDP1Y2019_DP02PR;ACSDP1Y2019_DP02;ACSDP1Y2019_DP03

American Community Survey: Supplemental Estimates: ACS 1-Year Supplemental Estimates,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

Population Estimates: National Monthly Population Estimates,"Monthly Population Estimates by Universe, Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States: April 1, 2010 to December 1, 2020  // Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division // Note: 'In combination' means in combination with one or more other races. The sum of the five race-in-combination groups adds to more than the total population because individuals may report more than one race. Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. Responses of 'Some Other Race' from the 2010 Census are modified. This results in differences between the population for specific race categories shown for the 2010 Census population in this file versus those in the original 2010 Census data. // The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. // Persons on active duty in the Armed Forces were not enumerated in the 2010 Census.

In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition each state into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

Decennial Census: Redistricting Data (PL 94-171),"Public Law 94-171, enacted in 1975, directs the Census Bureau to make special preparations to provide redistricting data needed by the 50 states. It specifies that within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the governor and legislative leadership in each state the data they need to redraw districts for the United States Congress and state legislature. To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords state officials an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting purposes. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks.

American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Comparison Profiles 1-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex. Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Comparison profiles are similar to Data profiles but also include comparisons with past-year data.

American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Data Profiles 1-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a US-wide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2021.0,acs›acs1›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/profile,acs,acs1,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP1Y2021,ACSDP1Y2021,ACSDP1Y2021,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP1Y2021_DP04;ACSDP1Y2021_DP05;ACSDP1Y2021_DP02PR;ACSDP1Y2021_DP02;ACSDP1Y2021_DP03
2021 American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample,"The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains a sample of responses to the ACS. The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition each state into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. Data are available at the state and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition Puerto Rico into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Subject Tables 1-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a US-wide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2021.0,acs›acs1›subject,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/subject/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/subject/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/subject/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/subject/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/subject/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/subject,acs,acs1,subject,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSST1Y2021,ACSST1Y2021,ACSST1Y2021,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSST1Y2021_S0103PR;ACSST1Y2021_S1601;ACSST1Y2021_S2414;ACSST1Y2021_S1602;ACSST1Y2021_S0502PR;ACSST1Y2021_S1603;ACSST1Y2021_S2419;ACSST1Y2021_S2418;ACSST1Y2021_S1001;ACSST1Y2021_S1002;ACSST1Y2021_S2411;ACSST1Y2021_S1201;ACSST1Y2021_S2413;ACSST1Y2021_S1401;ACSST1Y2021_S2412;ACSST1Y2021_S2404;ACSST1Y2021_S2602;ACSST1Y2021_S0501;ACSST1Y2021_S2403;ACSST1Y2021_S0502;ACSST1Y2021_S2406;ACSST1Y2021_S2802;ACSST1Y2021_S0503;ACSST1Y2021_S0701;ACSST1Y2021_S2405;ACSST1Y2021_S2603;ACSST1Y2021_S2801;ACSST1Y2021_S0504;ACSST1Y2021_S0702;ACSST1Y2021_S2408;ACSST1Y2021_S0505;ACSST1Y2021_S0901;ACSST1Y2021_S2407;ACSST1Y2021_S0506;ACSST1Y2021_S0902;ACSST1Y2021_S2409;ACSST1Y2021_S2601CPR;ACSST1Y2021_S2002;ACSST1Y2021_S2001;ACSST1Y2021_S0101;ACSST1Y2021_S2201;ACSST1Y2021_S0102;ACSST1Y2021_S2402;ACSST1Y2021_S0103;ACSST1Y2021_S2401;ACSST1Y2021_S0601PR;ACSST1Y2021_S2702PR;ACSST1Y2021_S0102PR;ACSST1Y2021_S1501;ACSST1Y2021_S1502;ACSST1Y2021_S1701;ACSST1Y2021_S1702;ACSST1Y2021_S2713;ACSST1Y2021_S1703;ACSST1Y2021_S1901;ACSST1Y2021_S1902;ACSST1Y2021_S2601A;ACSST1Y2021_S1903;ACSST1Y2021_S2601C;ACSST1Y2021_S1101;ACSST1Y2021_S1301;ACSST1Y2021_S2503;ACSST1Y2021_S2701;ACSST1Y2021_S1810;ACSST1Y2021_S2502;ACSST1Y2021_S0601;ACSST1Y2021_S1811;ACSST1Y2021_S2703;ACSST1Y2021_S2901;ACSST1Y2021_S2504;ACSST1Y2021_S2702;ACSST1Y2021_S0801;ACSST1Y2021_S2507;ACSST1Y2021_S0802;ACSST1Y2021_S2506;ACSST1Y2021_S2704;ACSST1Y2021_S0701PR;ACSST1Y2021_S0804;ACSST1Y2021_S1251;ACSST1Y2021_S2101;ACSST1Y2021_S2301;ACSST1Y2021_S2303;ACSST1Y2021_S2501;ACSST1Y2021_S2302

Population Estimates: National Monthly Population,"Monthly Population Estimates by Universe, Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States // Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division // Universes include the resident population, resident population plus Armed Forces overseas, civilian population, civilian noninstitutionalized population, and household population. The estimates are developed from an April 1, 2020 base population and may incorporate changes resulting from the Count Question Resolution program and/or geographic program revisions. 'In combination' means in combination with one or more other races. The sum of the five race-in-combination groups adds to more than the total population because individuals may report more than one race. Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. Responses of 'Some Other Race' from the Census are modified. This results in differences between the population for specific race categories shown in this file versus those in the Census data. // Current data on births, deaths, and migration are used to calculate population change since April 1, 2020. A time series of estimates is produced, beginning with April 1, 2020. The reference date for all estimates is the first of the month.

American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Comparison Profiles 1-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex. Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Comparison profiles are similar to Data profiles but also include comparisons with past-year data. The current year data are compared with each of the last four years of data and include statistical significance testing.

American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Data Profiles 1-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a US-wide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the US, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2022.0,acs›acs1›profile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/profile,acs,acs1,profile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP1Y2022,ACSDP1Y2022,ACSDP1Y2022,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSDP1Y2022_DP04;ACSDP1Y2022_DP05;ACSDP1Y2022_DP02PR;ACSDP1Y2022_DP02;ACSDP1Y2022_DP03
2022 American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample,"The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains a sample of responses to the ACS. The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels.

2022 American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample Puerto Rico,"The Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) for Puerto Rico (PR) contains a sample of responses to the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS). The PRCS is similar to, but separate from, the American Community Survey (ACS). The PRCS collects data about the population and housing units in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico data is not included in the national PUMS files. It is published as a state equivalent file and has a State FIPS code of ""72"". The file includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. Data are available at the state and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition Puerto Rico into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Subject Tables 1-Year,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a US-wide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",2022.0,acs›acs1›subject,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/subject/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/subject/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/subject/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/subject/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/subject/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/subject,acs,acs1,subject,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSST1Y2022,ACSST1Y2022,ACSST1Y2022,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSST1Y2022_S0103PR;ACSST1Y2022_S1601;ACSST1Y2022_S2414;ACSST1Y2022_S1602;ACSST1Y2022_S1603;ACSST1Y2022_S0502PR;ACSST1Y2022_S2419;ACSST1Y2022_S2418;ACSST1Y2022_S1001;ACSST1Y2022_S1002;ACSST1Y2022_S2411;ACSST1Y2022_S1201;ACSST1Y2022_S2413;ACSST1Y2022_S1401;ACSST1Y2022_S2412;ACSST1Y2022_S2404;ACSST1Y2022_S2602;ACSST1Y2022_S0501;ACSST1Y2022_S2403;ACSST1Y2022_S2406;ACSST1Y2022_S2802;ACSST1Y2022_S0502;ACSST1Y2022_S0503;ACSST1Y2022_S0701;ACSST1Y2022_S2405;ACSST1Y2022_S2603;ACSST1Y2022_S2801;ACSST1Y2022_S0504;ACSST1Y2022_S0702;ACSST1Y2022_S2408;ACSST1Y2022_S0505;ACSST1Y2022_S0901;ACSST1Y2022_S2407;ACSST1Y2022_S0506;ACSST1Y2022_S0902;ACSST1Y2022_S2409;ACSST1Y2022_S2601CPR;ACSST1Y2022_S2002;ACSST1Y2022_S2001;ACSST1Y2022_S0101;ACSST1Y2022_S2201;ACSST1Y2022_S0102;ACSST1Y2022_S2402;ACSST1Y2022_S0103;ACSST1Y2022_S2401;ACSST1Y2022_S0601PR;ACSST1Y2022_S2702PR;ACSST1Y2022_S0102PR;ACSST1Y2022_S1501;ACSST1Y2022_S1502;ACSST1Y2022_S1701;ACSST1Y2022_S1702;ACSST1Y2022_S2713;ACSST1Y2022_S1703;ACSST1Y2022_S1901;ACSST1Y2022_S1902;ACSST1Y2022_S2601A;ACSST1Y2022_S1903;ACSST1Y2022_S2601C;ACSST1Y2022_S1101;ACSST1Y2022_S1301;ACSST1Y2022_S2503;ACSST1Y2022_S2701;ACSST1Y2022_S1810;ACSST1Y2022_S2502;ACSST1Y2022_S0601;ACSST1Y2022_S1811;ACSST1Y2022_S2703;ACSST1Y2022_S2901;ACSST1Y2022_S2504;ACSST1Y2022_S2702;ACSST1Y2022_S0801;ACSST1Y2022_S2507;ACSST1Y2022_S0802;ACSST1Y2022_S2506;ACSST1Y2022_S2704;ACSST1Y2022_S0701PR;ACSST1Y2022_S0804;ACSST1Y2022_S1251;ACSST1Y2022_S2101;ACSST1Y2022_S2301;ACSST1Y2022_S2303;ACSST1Y2022_S2501;ACSST1Y2022_S2302

American Community Survey: 1-Year Supplemental Estimates,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.

The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

ACS 1-Year Comparison Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex. Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Comparison profiles are similar to Data profiles but also include comparisons with past-year data. The current year data are compared with each of the last four years of data and include statistical significance testing. There are over 1,000 variables in this dataset.",2023.0,acs›acs1›cprofile,Aggregate,http://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs1/cprofile/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs1/cprofile/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs1/cprofile/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs1/cprofile/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs1/cprofile/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs1/cprofile,acs,acs1,cprofile,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSCP1Y2023,ACSCP1Y2023,ACSCP1Y2023,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,ACSCP1Y2023_CP02;ACSCP1Y2023_CP02PR;ACSCP1Y2023_CP05;ACSCP1Y2023_CP04;ACSCP1Y2023_CP03
ACS 1-Year Data Profiles,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a US-wide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.

Survey of Market Absorption,"The Survey of Market Absorption of New Multifamily Units (SOMA), sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), uses the Census Bureau's Survey of Construction (SOC) as its sampling base. Each month, a sample of residential buildings containing five or more units is selected for SOMA. The initial 3-month interview collects information on amenities, rent or sales price levels, number of units, type of building, and the number of units taken off the market (absorbed). Field representatives conduct subsequent interviews, if necessary, at 6, 9, and 12 months after completion.",,timeseries›soma,,http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma/geography.html,http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma/variables.html,http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma/groups.html,http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma/sorts.html,http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma/examples.html,https://www.census.gov/developer/,http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma,timeseries,soma,,,,https://api.census.gov/data/id/SOMATIMESERIES,SOMATIMESERIES,SOMATIMESERIES,Has Example,No Sort,Has Geography,Has Group,SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0505;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0506;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0507;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0503;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0504;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0500;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0402;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0404;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0400;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACQ0208;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACQ0206;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACQ0207;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0409;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACQ0204;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0406;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACQ0203;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACQ0200;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0408;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0407;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0406;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0407;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0408;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0403;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0404;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0400;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0302;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0305;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0700;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACQ0307;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0300;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACQ0308;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0707;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACQ0306;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0706;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACQ0303;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0709;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0708;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0307;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0702;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0306;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0705;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0309;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACQ0300;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0704;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0308;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0302;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0300;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0100;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0308;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0309;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0306;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0307;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0109;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0102;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0104;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0106;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0107;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0108;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0707;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0708;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0703;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0307;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0704;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0308;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0705;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0706;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0303;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0700;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0305;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0306;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0300;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0600;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0602;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACP0203;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACP0204;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACP0206;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACP0207;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACP0208;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0608;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0607;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0609;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0604;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0606;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0605;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACP0200;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0608;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMAZA0800;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0604;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0208;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0605;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0606;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0607;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0600;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0204;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0205;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0206;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0603;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0207;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0200;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACA0203;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACP0300;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0105;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0500;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0104;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0107;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0502;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACP0303;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0106;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0100;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACP0306;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0102;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACP0307;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMACP0308;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0509;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0505;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0109;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0504;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0108;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0507;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARA0506;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0106;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0107;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0104;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0102;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0100;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0108;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARQ0109;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0307;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0308;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0309;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMAZA0805;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0300;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMAZA0806;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMAZA0807;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0302;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMAZA0808;SOMATIMESERIES_SOMARP0306
