The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP1997,Nonemployer Statistics staff,public,2017-02-09,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan.

The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP1998,Nonemployer Statistics staff,public,2017-02-09,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

nonemp,2000,2000 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2000,Nonemployer Statistics staff,public,2017-02-09,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2002,Nonemployer Statistics staff,public,2017-02-09,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

nonemp,2003,2003 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2003,Nonemployer Statistics staff,public,2017-02-09,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2004,Nonemployer Statistics staff,public,2017-02-09,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

nonemp,2005,2005 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2005,Nonemployer Statistics staff,public,2017-02-09,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

cbp,2006,2006 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns,"County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/CBP2006,CBP Staff,public,2019-02-13,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

nonemp,2006,2006 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2006,Nonemployer Statistics staff,public,2017-02-09,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2008,Nonemployer Statistics staff,public,2016-09-21,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2009,Nonemployer Statistics staff,public,2016-09-21,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

nonemp,2011,2011 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics,"Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.",http://api.census.gov/data/id/NONEMP2011,Nonemployer Statistics staff,public,2016-09-21,U.S. Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/developers/,census

Hispanics may be of any race. Responses of 'Some Other Race' from the 2010 Census are modified. This results in differences between the population for specific race categories shown for the 2010 Census population in this file versus those in the original 2010 Census data.

In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file.

The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",https://api.census.gov/data/id/ACSDP1Y2019,American Community Survey Office,public,2020-04-03 00:00:00.0,U.S. Census Bureau,https://www.census.gov/developers/,census
