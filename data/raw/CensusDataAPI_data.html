<td>1986 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>1986</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp</a></td>

<td>1990 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>1990</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp</a></td>

They differ from the postcensal estimates that are released annually because they rely on a formula that redistributes the difference between the April 1 postcensal estimate and April 1 census count for the end of the decade across the estimates for that decade. Meanwhile, the postcensal estimates incorporate current data on births, deaths, and migration to produce each new vintage of estimates, and to revise estimates for years back to the last census.

This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>1991</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1991/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1991/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1991/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1991/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1991/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1991/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/1991/cbp</a></td>

<td>1992 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>1992</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cbp</a></td>

<td>Mar 1992 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1992</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1992/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 1993 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1993</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1993/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>Wave 8 Survey of Income and Program Participation - 1993 Panel: Research Topical Modules</td><td>SIPP is a nationally representative longitudinal survey that provides comprehensive data about the income and government program participation of individuals and households in the United States. Every interview of the 1993 SIPP Panel included a topical module that asked for detailed information on one of a rotating group of topics. These microdata contain data for these rotating topics.  Interviews occurred every four months, with the first interview occurring between February 1993 to May 1993.</td><td>1993</td><td>sipp<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>topicalres<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>1993panel<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>wave8</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/sipp/topicalres/1993panel/wave8/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/sipp/topicalres/1993panel/wave8/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/sipp/topicalres/1993panel/wave8/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/sipp/topicalres/1993panel/wave8/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/sipp/topicalres/1993panel/wave8/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1993/sipp/topicalres/1993panel/wave8">http://api.census.gov/data/1993/sipp/topicalres/1993panel/wave8</a></td>

<td>1994 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>1994</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cbp</a></td>

<td>Mar 1994 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1994</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>1995 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>1995</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cbp</a></td>

<td>Mar 1995 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1995</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 1996 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1996</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 1997 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1997</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>1997 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

<td>1998 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>1998</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp</a></td>

<td>Mar 1998 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1998</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>1998 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>1998</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp</a></td>

CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 1999 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1999</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>1999 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>1999</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp</a></td>

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2000</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>Decennial Census: Redistricting Data (PL 94-171)</td><td>Public Law 94-171, enacted in 1975, directs the Census Bureau to make special preparations to provide redistricting data needed by the 50 states. It specifies that within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the governor and legislative leadership in each state the data they need to redraw districts for the United States Congress and state legislature. To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords state officials an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting purposes. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks. State participation in defining areas is voluntary and nonpartisan.</td><td>2000</td><td>dec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>pl</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl">http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl</a></td>

Summary File 3 consists of 813 detailed tables of Census 2000 social, economic and housing characteristics compiled from a sample of approximately 19 million housing units (about 1 in 6 households) that received the Census 2000 long-form questionnaire. Fifty-one tables are repeated for nine major race and Hispanic or Latino groups: White alone; Black or African American alone; American Indian and Alaska Native alone; Asian alone; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone; Some other race alone; Two or more races; Hispanic or Latino; and White alone, not Hispanic or Latino.

The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level.

The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

<td>2001 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2001</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp</a></td>

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 2002 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2002</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2002/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>2002 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2002</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2002/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2002/nonemp</a></td>

CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 2003 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2003</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>2003 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2003</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp</a></td>

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

<td>2004 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2004</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp</a></td>

CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 2005 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2005</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2005/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>2005 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2005</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp</a></td>

<td>2006 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners).

This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

<td>American Community Survey: 3-Year Estimates: Detailed Tables 3-Year</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

<td>2008 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 2008 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2008</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2008/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>2008 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2008</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp</a></td>

This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 2009 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2009</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2009/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>2009 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2009</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp</a></td>

The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2010</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>acs3<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>profile</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs3/profile/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs3/profile/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs3/profile/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs3/profile/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs3/profile/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs3/profile">http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs3/profile</a></td>

The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

<td>Decennial Census: American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File</td><td>The AIAN Summary File contains data on population characteristics, such as sex, age, average household size, household type, and relationship to householder.  The American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File (AIANSF) contains data on population characteristics, such as sex, age, average household size, household type, and relationship to householder. The file also includes housing characteristics, such as tenure (whether a housing unit is owner-occupied or renter- occupied) and age of householder for occupied housing units. Selected aggregates and medians also are provided. A complete listing of subjects in the AIANSF is found in Chapter 3, Subject Locator. The layout of the tables in the AIANSF is similar to that in Summary File 2 (SF 2). These data are presented in 47 population tables (identified with a "PCT") and 14 housing tables (identified with an "HCT") shown down to the census tract level; and 10 population tables (identified with a "PCO") shown down to the county level, for a total of 71 tables. 

Each table is iterated for the total population, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone or in combination, and 1,567 detailed tribes and tribal groupings. Tribes or tribal groupings are included on the iterations list if they met a threshold of at least 100 people in the 2010 Census. In addition, the presentation of AIANSF tables for any of the tribes and tribal groupings is subject to a population threshold of 100 or more people in a given geography. That is, if there are fewer than 100 people in a specific population group in a specific geographic area, their population and housing characteristics data are not available for that geographic area in the AIANSF. See Appendix H, Characteristic Iterations, for more information.</td><td>2010</td><td>dec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>aian</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/aian/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/aian/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/aian/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/aian/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/aian/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/aian">http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/aian</a></td>

It specifies that within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the governor and legislative leadership in each state the data they need to redraw congressional and state legislative districts. To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords the states an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks. State participation in defining areas is voluntary and nonpartisan.</td><td>2010</td><td>dec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>pl</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl">http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl</a></td>

<td>2010 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners).

The PRCS is similar to, but separate from, the American Community Survey (ACS). The PRCS collects data about the population and housing units in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico data is not included in the national PUMS files. It is published as a state equivalent file and has a State FIPS code of &ldquo;72&rdquo;. The file includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file.

<td>2011 American Community Survey 1-Year Profiles for the 113th Congressional Districts</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2011</td><td>acs1<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>cd113</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113">http://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs1/cd113</a></td>

CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 2011 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2011</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2011/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>2011 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2011</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp</a></td>

Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.
The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds.

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

<td>Mar 2012 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2012</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2012/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

NOTE: 
Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. 

The projections generally do not precisely agree with population estimates available elsewhere on the Census Bureau website for methodological reasons. Where both estimates and projections are available for a given time reference, we recommend that you use the population estimates as the measure of the current population.

The U.S. Census Bureau periodically produces projections of the United States resident population by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Population projections are estimates of the population for future dates. They are typically based on an estimated population consistent with the most recent decennial census and are produced using the cohort-component method. Projections illustrate possible courses of population change based on assumptions about future births, deaths, net international migration, and domestic migration. In some cases, several series of projections are produced based on alternative assumptions for future fertility, life expectancy, net international migration, and (for state-level projections) state-to-state or domestic migration.

<td>Mar 2013 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2013</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>ACS 1-Year Data Profiles</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2014</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>acs1<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>profile</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile">http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs1/profile</a></td>

Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2014</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>acsse</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acsse/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acsse/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acsse/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acsse/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acsse/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acsse">http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acsse</a></td>

<td>Vintage 2014 Population Estimates: State Population Estimates by Single Year of Age, Sex, 6 Races, and Hispanic Origin</td><td>Annual State Resident Population Estimates for 6 Race Groups (5 Race Alone Groups and Two or More Races) by Age, Sex, and Hispanic Origin // Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division // Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. Responses of 'Some Other Race' from the 2010 Census are modified. This results in differences between the population for specific race categories shown for the 2010 Census population in this file versus those in the original 2010 Census data. For more information, see http://www.census.gov/popest/data/historical/files/MRSF-01-US1.pdf. // For detailed information about the methods used to create the population estimates, see http://www.census.gov/popest/methodology/index.html. // Each year, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program (PEP) utilizes current data on births, deaths, and migration to calculate population change since the most recent decennial census, and produces a time series of estimates of population. The annual time series of estimates begins with the most recent decennial census data and extends to the vintage year. The vintage year (e.g., V2013) refers to the final year of the time series. The reference date for all estimates is July 1, unless otherwise specified. With each new issue of estimates, the Census Bureau revises estimates for years back to the last census. As each vintage of estimates includes all years since the most recent decennial census, the latest vintage of data available supersedes all previously produced estimates for those dates.

After comparison with other Census Bureau data collection efforts, the Census Bureau determined that the 2010 Census enumeration of the group quarters population in these areas was incomplete.

The PRCS is similar to, but separate from, the American Community Survey (ACS). The PRCS collects data about the population and housing units in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico data is not included in the national PUMS files. It is published as a state equivalent file and has a State FIPS code of &ldquo;72&rdquo;. The file includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. Data are available at the state and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition Puerto Rico into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

<td>ACS 1-Year Supplemental Estimates</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2015</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>acsse</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse">http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse</a></td>

<td>Vintage 2015 Population Estimates: Characteristics by Single Year of Age</td><td>Annual Resident Population Estimates by Single Year of Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin // Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division // The contents of this file are released on a rolling basis from December through June. // Note: 'In combination' means in combination with one or more other races. The sum of the five race-in-combination groups adds to more than the total population because individuals may report more than one race. Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. Responses of 'Some Other Race' from the 2010 Census are modified. This results in differences between the population for specific race categories shown for the 2010 Census population in this file versus those in the original 2010 Census data. For more information, see http://www.census.gov/popest/data/historical/files/MRSF-01-US1.pdf. // The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. // For detailed information about the methods used to create the population estimates, see http://www.census.gov/popest/methodology/index.html. // Each year, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program (PEP) utilizes current data on births, deaths, and migration to calculate population change since the most recent decennial census, and produces a time series of estimates of population. The annual time series of estimates begins with the most recent decennial census data and extends to the vintage year. The vintage year (e.g., V2015) refers to the final year of the time series.

<td>ACS 1-Year Data Profiles</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2016</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>acs1<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>profile</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile">http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile</a></td>

<td>ACS 1-Year Supplemental Estimates</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2016</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>acsse</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse">http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acsse</a></td>

The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

<td>ACS 1-Year Data Profiles</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.

The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups.

<td>Mar 2017 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2017</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>National Population Projections: Projected Population by Single Year of Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States: 2016-2060</td><td>Projected Population by Single Year of Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States: 2016 to 2060 // Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division // There are four projection scenarios: 1. Main series, 2. High Immigration series, 3. Low Immigration series, and 4. Zero Immigration series. // Note: 'In combination' means in combination with one or more other races. The sum of the five race-in-combination groups adds to more than the total population because individuals may report more than one race. Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. // The projections generally do not precisely agree with population estimates available elsewhere on the Census Bureau website for methodological reasons. Where both estimates and projections are available for a given time reference, it is recommended that you use the population estimates as the measure of the current population. // For detailed information about the methods used to create the population projections, see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popproj/technical-documentation/methodology/methodstatement17.pdf. // Population projections are estimates of the population for future dates. They are typically based on an estimated population consistent with the most recent decennial census and are produced using the cohort-component method. Projections illustrate possible courses of population change based on assumptions about future births, deaths, net international migration, and domestic migration.

<td>ACS 1-Year Profile Tables</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2018</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>acs1<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>profile</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile">http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs1/profile</a></td>

<td>ACS 1-Year Supplemental Estimates</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2018</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>acsse</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse">http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse</a></td>

Estimates for MCDs are only available for the 12 strong-MCD states, where the MCDs have the same government functions as incorporated places. Migration flows between metropolitan statistical areas are available starting with the 2009-2013 5-year ACS dataset. Flow statistics are available by three or four variables for each dataset starting with the 2006-2010 5-year ACS datasets. The variables change for each dataset and do not repeat in overlapping datasets. In addition to the flow estimates, there are supplemental statistics files that contain migration/geographical mobility estimates (e.g., nonmovers, moved to a different state, moved from abroad) for each county, MCD, or metro area.</td><td>2018</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>flows</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/flows/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/flows/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/flows/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/flows/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/flows/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/flows">http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/flows</a></td>

Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2019</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>acs1<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>profile</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile">http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile</a></td>

It specifies that within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the governor and legislative leadership in each state the data they need to redraw districts for the United States Congress and state legislature. To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords state officials an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting purposes. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks.

<td>2021 American Community Survey: 5-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample Puerto Rico</td><td>The Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) for Puerto Rico (PR) contains a sample of responses to the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS). The PRCS is similar to, but separate from, the American Community Survey (ACS). The PRCS collects data about the population and housing units in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico data is not included in the national PUMS files. It is published as a state equivalent file and has a State FIPS code of "72". The file includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. Data are available at the state and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition Puerto Rico into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

<td>American Community Survey: 1-Year Supplemental Estimates</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2021</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>acsse</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acsse/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acsse/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acsse/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acsse/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acsse/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acsse">http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acsse</a></td>

The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels.

<td>American Community Survey: 1-Year Supplemental Estimates</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2022</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>acsse</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acsse/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acsse/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acsse/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acsse/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acsse/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acsse">http://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acsse</a></td>

A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

<td>ACS 1-Year Comparison Profiles</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population.

The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections. To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional Hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

<td>Survey of Market Absorption</td><td>The Survey of Market Absorption of New Multifamily Units (SOMA), sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), uses the Census Bureau's Survey of Construction (SOC) as its sampling base. Each month, a sample of residential buildings containing five or more units is selected for SOMA. The initial 3-month interview collects information on amenities, rent or sales price levels, number of units, type of building, and the number of units taken off the market (absorbed). Field representatives conduct subsequent interviews, if necessary, at 6, 9, and 12 months after completion.</td><td><span class="na">N/A</span></td><td>timeseries<span class="hier-sep">&rsaquo; </span>soma</td><td><span class="na">N/A</span></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma">http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/soma</a></td>
